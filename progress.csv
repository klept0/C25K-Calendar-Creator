# Couch to 5K Progress Tracker
# Fill in the fields as you complete each session. Macros: =TODAY() for date, =IF(...), etc.
# --- Advanced Macros and Columns ---
# Add these columns to the right of 'notes':
# Current_Streak,Missed,Adjust_Plan,Effort,Milestone,Weather
#
# Example formulas (Google Sheets/Excel):
# In F2 (Current_Streak): =IF(D2="Y",1,0)
# In F3 and down: =IF(D3="Y",F2+1,0)
# In G2 (Missed): =IF(AND(C2="",TODAY()-DATE(2025,7,15)+(ROW()-2)*2>2),"Missed","")
# In H2 (Adjust_Plan): =IF(COUNTIF($D$2:$D$31,"N")>=3,"Consider repeating this week or shifting plan","On Track")
# In I2 (Effort): (User: 1-5 or Easy/Medium/Hard)
# In J2 (Milestone): =IF(AND(A2=1,B2=3),"First week done!",IF(AND(A2=5,B2=3),"Halfway!",IF(AND(A2=10,B2=3),"C25K Complete!","")))
# In K2 (Weather): (User: log weather/conditions)
#
# Progress percent (any cell): =COUNTIF(D2:D31,"Y")/COUNTA(D2:D31)
# Longest streak (any cell): =MAX(F2:F31)
# Sessions missed (any cell): =COUNTIF(G2:G31,"Missed")
#
# For weekly summary, insert a row after each week and use:
# Sessions Completed: =COUNTIF(D2:D4,"Y") (adjust range per week)
# Sessions Missed: =COUNTIF(G2:G4,"Missed")
# Motivational Msg: =IF([Sessions Completed]=3,"Great job!","Keep going!")
#
# For auto-backup/versioning: Use File > Version history (Google Sheets) or VBA macro (Excel).

# Example macros:
# - To auto-fill today's date: type =TODAY() in the date_completed cell
# - To mark completion: type Y or N in the completed cell
# - To add notes, use the notes cell

# Total completed sessions:
# =COUNTIF(D2:D31,"Y")
# Progress percentage:
# =COUNTIF(D2:D31,"Y")/COUNTA(D2:D31)
# Next session to complete (row number):
# =MATCH("",D2:D31,0)+1
# Days since last session:
# =TODAY()-MAX(C2:C31)
# Motivational message:
# =IF(COUNTIF(D2:D31,"Y")=COUNTA(D2:D31),"Congratulations! You finished!","Keep going, you're doing great!")
