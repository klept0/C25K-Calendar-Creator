- **Macros & Instructions Sheet:** All advanced macros, formulas, and usage instructions are included in a dedicated sheet. You can copy-paste or review them directly in Excel.
- **Auto-Insertion:** Macros and formulas are auto-inserted using the included `c25k_excel_macro_inserter.py` script. You can run this script manually if needed.
- **Advanced Visual Cues:** The tracker includes checkmarks, rest day highlighting, overdue alerts, sparklines, milestone badges, weekly progress bars, goal gauge, weather icons/colors, accessibility macro, and notes highlighting.
- **Improved Formatting:** Columns are auto-sized, all cells are wrapped and aligned, code blocks use a monospaced font and shading, and the top row is frozen for easy navigation.
- **Accessibility:** High-contrast and large-font options are available for improved readability.

All formulas/macros are beginner-friendly and can be copy-pasted or are pre-filled in the Excel file. See the "Macros & Instructions" sheet in your progress tracker for more details.
