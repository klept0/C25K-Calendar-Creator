**Default Settings:**

- Units: Imperial (lbs)
- Temperature: Fahrenheit (Â°F)

The tool defaults to imperial units and Fahrenheit for weather. You can change these in the prompts or settings.

## Weather Integration (OpenWeatherMap)

This tool can fetch real weather forecasts for your session dates if you provide a city or ZIP code. To enable this feature:

1. Sign up for a free API key at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).
2. **Set your API key as an environment variable (recommended for security and convenience):**

   For macOS/zsh users, add this line to your `~/.zshrc` file:
   ```sh
   export OWM_API_KEY="your_actual_api_key_here"
   ```
   Then reload your shell configuration:
   ```sh
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```
   Replace `your_actual_api_key_here` with your real OpenWeatherMap API key.

   Alternatively, for a one-off run, you can set the variable inline:
   ```sh
   OWM_API_KEY="your_actual_api_key_here" python3 c25k_ics_generator.py
   ```

3. The script will automatically use the API key from the `OWM_API_KEY` environment variable. You do not need to type it in each time.

4. If no API key is set, the tool will use a built-in weather stub for demo purposes.

**Security note:** Never commit your API key to version control or share it in plaintext. Environment variables are only visible to your user and processes you run.

See the code and documentation for more details.

<details>
<summary>Wearables Import Instructions</summary>

- **Apple Health:** Export your plan as a Health-compatible CSV file. Import into Apple Health using the Shortcuts app or a 3rd-party tool (e.g., Health Importer). Map columns to "Running" workouts as needed.
- **Google Fit:** Export your plan as a Google Fit CSV file. Import into Google Fit using the web interface or a compatible app.
- **Strava/Runkeeper:** Export your plan directly to Strava or Runkeeper by entering your API token at the prompt. Each session will be uploaded as a planned activity. Your token is used only for export and is not stored.

See the tool README for more details and troubleshooting tips.

# C25K Calendar Creator (GUI Edition)

## Quick Start (GUI Only)

- **Install dependencies:**
  - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all required packages (PyQt6, openpyxl, requests, qrcode[pil], reportlab).
- **Launch the PyQt6 GUI:**
  - Run `python c25k_ics_generator.py` to launch the GUI.
  - All plan creation, export, and accessibility features are available via the GUI.
  - The GUI is accessible, user-friendly, and supports all export types (ICS, CSV, JSON, Google Fit, Markdown, Strava/Runkeeper, Apple Health, PDF, QR, and Excel tracker).

- **Persistent Preferences:**
  - Your settings (name, age, weight, accessibility, etc.) are saved automatically to `.c25k_prefs.json` in your home directory.
  - Click "Save Preferences" in the GUI to save your current settings. They will be restored next time you launch the app.

- **Accessibility:**
  - All accessibility features (high-contrast, large font, dyslexia font, light mode, screen reader, increased spacing, focus highlight) are grouped in a dedicated Accessibility flyout in the GUI.
  - Accessibility options apply to all exports and the GUI itself.

- **Onboarding & Help:**
  - On first launch, a welcome dialog explains the workflow and accessibility options.
  - A Help menu provides access to About and Screenshots.

- **Feedback:**
  - Use the "Send Feedback" button in the GUI to submit suggestions or issues. Feedback is saved locally for privacy.

- **Export Success Dialogs:**
  - After each export, a dialog confirms success and shows a clickable path to the output file.

- **Calendar Widget:**
  - The right side of the GUI features a visual calendar that highlights only actual workout days, skipping rest days.
  - Milestone days (end of each week) are color-coded gold, and tooltips are shown for each workout/milestone day.
  - Click any highlighted day to see session details in a popup.

- **Screenshots:**
  - Use the Help menu to view screenshots of the GUI. (Add your own screenshots to the `screenshots/` folder.)



- **Advanced Features:**
  - All export types, analytics, and accessibility features are available from the GUI.
  - See the tool README (`c25k_ics_generator_readme.md`) for full details on export formats, analytics, and advanced options.

---

**Platform Support:**

- The GUI is cross-platform and works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. If you encounter issues with PyQt6 installation, see the troubleshooting section below.

---

**Troubleshooting:**

- If you see errors about missing modules, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- For PyQt6 installation issues on Linux, you may need to install system Qt libraries (see PyQt6 docs).
- If you have permission issues saving preferences, ensure you have write access to your home directory.
- For OpenWeatherMap API errors, check your API key and internet connection.
- For any other issues, see the tool README or open an issue on GitHub.

---

**Accessibility:**

- High-contrast mode (GUI, Markdown, Excel, PDF)
- Large font and dyslexia-friendly font options (Comic Sans MS or OpenDyslexic if available)
- Semantic headings and ARIA roles in Markdown export
- PDF export includes an explicit accessibility note, semantic headings, and high-contrast/large font/dyslexia-friendly font options
- Screen reader compatibility: Markdown and Excel exports are optimized for screen readers (avoid merged cells, clear headers, semantic structure). PDF accessibility is improved but may be limited by PDF readersâsee the accessibility note in the PDF export for details.
- All accessibility features are documented in the README and in the Excel trackerâs "Macros & Instructions" sheet.

## Screenshots

*Add screenshots or a GIF of the GUI here for visual reference. The GUI now features onboarding, a Help menu, feedback dialog, export success dialogs, and a polished calendar widget with color-coded milestones and tooltips.*
