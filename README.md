The tool defaults to imperial units and Fahrenheit for weather. You can change these in the prompts or settings.

## Weather Integration (OpenWeatherMap)

This tool can fetch real weather forecasts for your session dates if you provide a city or ZIP code. To enable this feature:

1. Sign up for a free API key at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).
2. Set your API key as an environment variable before running the script:

   ```sh
   export OWM_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key
   ```
   Or, replace the placeholder in the code with your API key.

3. If no API key is set, the tool will use a built-in weather stub for demo purposes.

See the code and documentation for more details.
